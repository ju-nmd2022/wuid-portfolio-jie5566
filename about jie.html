            <h3>Why I am studying NMD</h3>
            <p>I love painting and other creative things. Design has always been my passion. When I was little, I always dreamed I would be an designer. Unfortunately, I didn't get chance to learn what I really love. Instead, I learned Biology and got a master degree of it, but I found out that myself not able to have deep affection for it. After working as a marketing manager, preschool teacher, I decied to learn New media design to achieve my dream.</p>
